#	Inspired by code written by @andrewewa
#
#	Allo Relay Attenuator
#	- volume range: 63 - 127 (64 steps)
#	- 63 or less is mute ON
#	- 64 is 0dB
#	- 127 is -63dB
#	- mute is on 6th bit (counted from 0), 0 is mute ON, 1 is mute OFF
#	- overall value for volume is in range of 0 - 127, but mute being off makes it 64 - 127
#
#	Configuration
#	- sudo apt-get -y install python-smbus i2c-tools libi2c-dev
#	- sudo nano /etc/modules
# /etc/modules: kernel modules to load at boot time.
#
# This file contains the names of kernel modules that should be loaded
# at boot time, one per line. Lines beginning with "#" are ignored.
